# Angular-dependence-of-MatriXX
  MatriXX Evolution is a 2D ion chamber array which can be of use for verification of IMRT and VMAT treatment plans. The MatriXX experiences angular dependency and for its correction different methods have been described. In the document "MatriXX_correction.pdf" is described efficient procedure for correction of the MatriXX dependency, which can be carried out straightforward with the developed application. The application purpose is investigation and correction of the angle dependency of the MatriXX Evolution detector and similar 2D ion chamber arrays. To use the application simply unzip "build.7z" and run gui.exe (the icon is a small MatriXX).
